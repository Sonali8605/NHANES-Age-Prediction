# Logistic Regression Model on NHANES Dataset

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains a logistic regression analysis performed on the NHANES dataset. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation of the logistic regression model.

## Dataset

#### NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)

- The dataset is used to analyze various health and nutrition parameters.

- It includes demographic, dietary, and medical examination data.

- The target variable for logistic regression is a binary classification problem.
## Dependencies

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas

- numpy

- scikit-learn

- matplotlib

- seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps in the Notebook

1.**Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and performing initial exploration.

2.**Data Preprocessing**:

- Handling missing values

- Encoding categorical variables

- Scaling numerical features

- Splitting data into training and testing sets

3.**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the dataset using plots and summary statistics.

4.**Logistic Regression Model:**

- Training the model using scikit-learn

- Evaluating performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results

- The logistic regression model provides insights into the relationships between health parameters and the target variable.

- Performance metrics indicate the model's effectiveness in classification.

- Possible improvements include feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and trying other classification algorithms.

## Conclusion

The logistic regression model applied to the NHANES dataset successfully identifies key factors influencing the target variable. While the model provides reasonable classification accuracy, further refinements, such as advanced feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and alternative modeling techniques (e.g., decision trees or ensemble methods), could enhance predictive performance. The findings offer valuable insights for health data analysis and support data-driven decision-making in medical research.
